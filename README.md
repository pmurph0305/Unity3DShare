Allows you to sharpen the image without using TSAA.

This post processing effect was made by seperating it out from the default TSAA shader in Unity's PostProcessing Package.

Put the files in your project, then add the effect to a Post Processing Volume like other post processing effects. Located under Custom/Sharpen.
